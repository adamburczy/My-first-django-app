This is my first django project done by myself, after week and a half of learning django form "django by example 2" book by Antonio Mele. Thats just simple to-do app, kinda boring stuff for me, but i added some extra feautures like login system. Nothing crazy, im posting it here just to see how i will progress in the future :D
